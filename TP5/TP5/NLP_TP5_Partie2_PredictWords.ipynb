              "'When Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desperately \\nHe was lying by the fire, which was now piled high and burning brightly \\nHis three companions were bending over him \\n\\'What has happened? Where is the pale king?\\' he asked wildly \\nThey were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a while; nor did they understand his question \\nAt length he gathered from Sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them \\nSuddenly to his horror Sam found that his master had vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and he fell \\nHe heard Frodo\\'s voice, but it seemed to come from a great distance, or from under the earth, crying out strange words \\nThey saw nothing more, until they stumbled over the body of Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him \\nStrider ordered them to pick him up and lay him near the fire, and then he disappeared \\nThat was now a good while ago.\\n     Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider; but while they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out of the shadows \\nThey started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but Strider knelt down swiftly at his side.\\n     \\'I am not a Black Rider, Sam,\\' he said gently, \\'nor in league with them \\nI have been trying to discover something of their movements; but I have found nothing \\nI cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again \\nBut there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand.\\'\\n     When he heard what Frodo had to tell, he became full of concern, and shook his head and sighed \\nThen he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much water as they could in their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with it \\n\\'Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!\\' he said \\nThen he got up and walked away, and called Sam to him \\n\\'I think I understand things better now,\\' he said in a low voice \\n\\'There seem only to have been five of the enemy \\nWhy they were not all here, I don\\'t know; but I don\\'t think they expected to be resisted \\nThey have drawn off for the time being \\nBut not far, I fear \\nThey will come again another night, if we cannot escape \\nThey are only waiting, because they think that their purpose is almost accomplished, and that the Ring cannot fly much further \\nI fear, Sam, that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their will \\nWe shall see!\\' Sam choked with tears \\n\\'Don\\'t despair!\\' said Strider \\n\\'You must trust me now \\nYour Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so \\nHe is not slain, and I think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect \\nI will do all I can to help and heal him \\nGuard him well, while I am away!\\' He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness.\\n     Frodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side \\nHis friends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound \\nThe night passed slowly and wearily \\nDawn was growing in the sky, and the dell was filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned.\\n     \\'Look!\\' he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness \\nA foot above the lower hem there was a slash \\n\\'This was the stroke of Frodo\\'s sword,\\' he said \\n\\'The only hurt that it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades perish that pierce that dreadful King \\nMore deadly to him was the name of Elbereth.\\'\\n     \\'And more deadly to Frodo was this!\\' He stooped again and lifted up a long thin knife \\nThere was a cold gleam in it \\nAs Strider raised it they saw that near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off \\nBut even as he held it up in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for the blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only the hilt in Strider\\'s hand \\n\\'Alas!\\' he cried \\n\\'It was this accursed knife that gave the wound \\nFew now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons \\nBut I will do what I can.\\'\\n     He sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger-hilt laid it on his knees, and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue \\nThen setting it aside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch \\nFrom the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a plant.\\n     \\'These leaves,\\' he said, \\'I have walked far to find; for this plant does not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away south of the Road I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves.\\' He crushed a leaf in his fingers, and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance \\n\\'It is fortunate that I could find it, for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West brought to Middle-earth \\n_Athelas_ they named it, and it grows now sparsely and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old; and it is not known in the North, except to some of those who wander in the Wild \\nIt has great virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.\\'\\n     He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo\\'s shoulder \\nThe fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared \\nThe herb had also some power over the wound, for Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side; but the life did not return to his arm, and he could not raise or use his hand \\nHe bitterly regretted his foolishness, and reproached himself for weakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies \\nHe wondered if he would remain maimed for life, and how they would now manage to continue their journey \\nHe fell too weak to stand.\\n     The others were discussing this very question \\nThey quickly decided to leave Weathertop as soon as possible \\n\\'I think now,\\' said Strider, \\'that the enemy has been watching this place for some days \\nIf Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return \\nIn any case we are in great peril here after dark, since the attack of last night, and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.\\'\\n     As soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and packed \\nIt was impossible for Frodo to walk, so they divided the greater part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo on the pony \\nIn the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters, especially for Sam \\nBill Ferny\\'s treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life.\\n     They started off in a southerly direction \\nThis would mean crossing the Road, but \\nit was the quickest way to more wooded country \\nAnd they needed fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm, especially at night, while fire would be some protection for them all \\nIt was also his plan to shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the Road: east beyond Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards.\\n     They made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-western slopes of the hill, and came in a little while to the edge of the Road \\nThere was no sign of the Riders \\nBut even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering \\nTrembling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead \\nThe land before them sloped away southwards, but it was wild and pathless; bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in between \\nThe grass was scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves in the thickets were faded and falling \\nIt was a cheerless land, and their journey was slow and gloomy \\nThey spoke little as they trudged along \\nFrodo\\'s heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, and their backs bowed under their burdens \\nEven Strider seemed tired and heavy-hearted.\\n     Before the first day\\'s march was over Frodo\\'s pain began to grow again, but he did not speak of it for a long time \\nFour days passed, without the ground or the scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop slowly sank, and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer \\nYet since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked their flight or followed them \\nThey dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch in pairs by night, expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the grey night, dimly lit by the cloud-veiled moon; but they saw nothing, and heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass \\nNot once did they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in the dell \\nIt seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already lost their trail again \\nPerhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow place?\\n     At the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended \\nStrider now turned their course again north-eastwards, and on the sixth day they reached the top of a long slow-climbing slope, and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills \\nAway below them they could see the Road sweeping round the feet of the hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine \\nIn the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half-veiled in mist.\\n     \"I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while,\\' said Strider \\n\\'We have now come to the River Hoarwell, that the Elves call Mitheithel \\nIt flows down out of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells north of Rivendell, and joins the Loudwater away in the South \\nSome call it the Greyflood after that \\nIt is a great water before it finds the Sea \\nThere is no way over it below its sources in the Ettenmoors, except by the Last Bridge on which the Road crosses.\\'\\n     \\'What is that other river we can see far away there?\\' asked Merry.\\n     \\'That is Loudwater, the Bruinen of Rivendell,\\' answered Strider \\n\\'The Road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the Ford of Bruinen \\nBut I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water \\nOne river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last Bridge held against us.\\'\\n     Next day, early in the morning, they came down again to the borders of the Road \\nSam and Strider went forward, but they found no sign of any travellers or riders \\nHere under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain \\nStrider judged that it had fallen two days before, and had washed away all footprints \\nNo horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see.\\n     They hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after a mile or two they saw the Last Bridge ahead, at the bottom of a short steep slope \\nThey dreaded to see black figures waiting there, but they saw none \\nStrider made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the Road, while he went forward to explore.\\n     Before long he came hurrying back \\n\\'I can see no sign of the enemy,\\' he said, \\'and I wonder very much what that means \\nBut I have found something very strange.\\'\\n     He held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel \\n\\'I found it in the mud in the middle of the Bridge,\\' he said \\n\\'It is a beryl, an elf-stone \\nWhether it was set there, or let fall by chance, I cannot say; but it brings hope to me \\nI will take it as a sign that we may pass the Bridge; but beyond that I dare not keep to the Road, without some clearer token.\\'\\n     At once they went on again \\nThey crossed the Bridge in safety, hearing no sound but the water swirling against its three great arches \\nA mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the Road \\nHere Strider turned aside, and soon they were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills.\\n     The hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous Road behind them; but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly \\nAs they went forward the hills about them steadily rose \\nHere and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and the ruins of towers: they had an ominous look \\nFrodo, who was not walking, had time to gaze ahead and to think \\nHe recalled Bilbo\\'s account of his journey and the threatening towers on the hills north of the Road, in the country near the Troll\\'s wood where his first serious adventure had happened \\nFrodo guessed that they were now in the same region, and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot.\\n     \\'Who lives in this land?\\' he asked \\n\\'And who built these towers? Is this troll-country?\\'\\n     \\'No!\\' said Strider \\n\\'Trolls do not build \\nNo one lives in this land \\nMen once dwelt here, ages ago; but none remain now \\nThey became an evil people, as legends tell, for they fell under the shadow of Angmar \\nBut all were destroyed in the war that brought the North Kingdom to its end \\nBut that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them, though a shadow still lies on the land.\\'\\n     \\'Where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty and forgetful?\\' asked Peregrin \\n\\'The birds and beasts do not tell tales of that son.\\'\\n     \\'The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past,\\' said Strider; \\'and many more things than I can tell are remembered in Rivendell.\\' \\'Have you often been to Rivendell?\\' said Frodo \\n\\'I have,\\' said Strider \\n\\'I dwelt there once, and still I return when I may.\\n     There my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in peace, even in the fair house of Elrond.\\'\\n     The hills now began to shut them in \\nThe Road behind held on its way to the River Bruinen, but both were now hidden from view \\nThe travellers came into a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark and silent \\nTrees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs, and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine-wood.\\n     The hobbits grew very weary \\nThey advanced slowly, for they had to pick their way through a pathless country, encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks \\nAs long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodo\\'s sake, and because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales \\nThey had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet \\nThe wind began to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain \\nBy nightfall they were all soaked, and their camp was cheerless, for they could not get any fire to burn \\nThe next day the hills rose still higher and steeper before them, and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their course \\nStrider seemed to be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out from Weathertop, and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low \\nIt went on raining.\\n     That night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock-wall behind them, in which there was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in the cliff \\nFrodo was restless \\nThe cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever, and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep \\nHe lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks of rock, water dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone \\nHe felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him; but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting hunched up, smoking his pipe, and watching \\nHe lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream, in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the Shire, but it seemed faint and dim, less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge.\\n     In the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped \\nThe clouds were still thick, but they were breaking, and pale strips of blue appeared between them \\nThe wind was shifting again \\nThey did not start early \\nImmediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast Strider went off alone, telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff, until he came back \\nHe was going to climb up, if he could, and get a look at the lie of the land.\\n     When he returned he was not reassuring \\n\\'We have come too far to the north,\\' he said, \\'and we must find some way to turn back southwards again \\nIf we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the Ettendales far north of Rivendell \\nThat is troll-country, and little known to me \\nWe could perhaps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north; but it would take too long, for I do not know the way, and our food would not last \\nSo somehow or other we must find the Ford of Bruinen.\\'\\n     The rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground \\nThey found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running south-east, the direction that they wished to take; but towards the end of the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land; its dark edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw \\nThey had a choice between going back or climbing over it.\\n     They decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult \\nBefore long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot \\nEven so they often despaired of getting their pony up, or indeed of finding a path for themselves, burdened as they were \\nThe light was nearly gone, and they were all exhausted, when at last they reached the top \\nThey had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two higher points, and the land fell steeply away again, only a short distance ahead \\nFrodo threw himself down, and lay on the ground shivering \\nHis left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon them \\nThe trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim.\\n     \\'We cannot go any further,\\' said Merry to Strider \\n\\'I am afraid this has been too much for Frodo \\nI am dreadfully anxious about him \\nWhat are we to do? Do you think they will be able to cure him in Rivendell, if we ever get there?\\'\\n     \\'We shall see,\\' answered Strider \\n\\'There is nothing more that I can do in the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of his wound that I am so anxious to press on \\nBut I agree that we can go no further tonight.\\'\\n     \\'What is the matter with my master?\\' asked Sam in a low voice, looking appealingly at Strider \\n\\'His wound was small, and it is already closed \\nThere\\'s nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder.\\'\\n     \\'Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,\\' said Strider, \\'and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive out \\nBut do not give up hope, Sam!\\'\\n     Night was cold up on the high ridge \\nThey lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots of an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit: it looked as if stone had once been quarried there \\nThey sat huddled together \\nThe wind blew chill through the pass, and they heard the tree-tops lower down moaning and sighing \\nFrodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping by above him, and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hills.\\n     The morning dawned bright and fair; the air was clean, and the light pale and clear in a rain-washed sky \\nTheir hearts were encouraged, but (hey longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs \\nAs soon as it was light, Strider took Merry with him and went to survey the country from the height to the east of the pass \\nThe sun had risen and was shining brightly when he returned with more comforting news \\nThey were now going more or less in the right direction \\nIf they went on, down the further side of the ridge, they would have the Mountains on their left \\nSome way ahead Strider had caught a glimpse of the Loudwater again, and he knew that, though it was hidden from view, the Road to the Ford was not far from the River and lay on the side nearest to them.\\n     \\'We must make for the Road again,\\' he said \\n\\'We cannot hope to find a path through these hills \\nWhatever danger may beset it, the Road is our only way to the Ford.\\'\\n     As soon as they had eaten they set out again \\nThey climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge; but the way was much easier than they had expected, for the slope was far less steep on this side, and before long Frodo was able to ride again \\nBill Ferny\\'s poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many jolts as possible \\nThe spirits of the party rose again \\nEven Frodo felt better in the morning light, but every now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes.\\n     Pippin was a little ahead of the others \\nSuddenly he turned round and called to them \\n\\'There is a path here!\\' he cried.\\n     When they came up with him, they saw that he had made no mistake:\\n     there were clearly the beginnings of a path, that climbed with many windings out of the woods below and faded away on the hill-top behind \\nIn places it was now faint and overgrown, or choked with fallen stones and trees; but at one time it seemed to have been much used \\nIt was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet \\nHere and there old trees had been cut or broken down, and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way.\\n     They followed the track for some while, for it offered much the easiest way down, but they went cautiously, and their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods, and the path grew plainer and broader \\nSuddenly coming out of a belt of fir-trees it ran steeply down a slope, and turned sharply to the left round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill \\nWhen they came to the comer they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees \\nIn the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge.\\n     Outside the door they all halted \\nThere was a cave or rock-chamber behind, but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen \\nStrider, Sam, and Merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little wider, and then Strider and Merry went in \\nThey did not go far, for on the floor lay many old bones, and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots.\\n     \\'Surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was one!\\' said Pippin \\n\\'Come out, you two, and let us get away \\nNow we know who made the path -and we had better get off it quick.\\'\\n     \\'There is no need, I think,\\' said Strider, coining out \\n\\'It is certainly a troll-hole, but it seems to have been long forsaken \\nI don\\'t think we need be afraid \\nBut let us go on down warily, and we shall see.\\'\\n     The path went on again from the door, and turning to the right again across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope \\nPippin, not liking to show Strider that he was still afraid, went on ahead with Merry \\nSam and Strider came behind, one on each side of Frodo\\'s pony, for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast \\nBut they had not gone very far before Pippin came running back, followed by Merry \\nThey both looked terrified.\\n     \\'There _are_ trolls!\\' Pippin panted \\n\\'Down in a clearing in the woods not far below \\nWe got a sight of them through the tree-trunks \\nThey are very large!\\'\\n     \\'We will come and look at them,\\' said Strider, picking up a stick \\nFrodo said nothing, but Sam looked scared.\\n     The sun was now high, and it shone down through the half-stripped branches of the trees, and lit the clearing with bright patches of light \\nThey halted suddenly on the edge, and peered through the tree-trunks, holding their breath \\nThere stood the trolls: three large trolls \\nOne was stooping, and the other two stood staring at him.\\n     Strider walked forward unconcernedly \\n\\'Get up, old stone!\\' he said, and broke his stick upon the stooping troll.\\n     Nothing happened \\nThere was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits, and then even Frodo laughed \\n\\'Well!\\' he said \\n\\'We are forgetting our family history! These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf, quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.\\'\\n     \\'I had no idea we were anywhere near the place!\\' said Pippin \\nHe knew the story well \\nBilbo and Frodo had told it often; but as a matter of fact he had never more than half believed it \\nEven now he looked at the stone trolls with suspicion, wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them to life again.\\n     \\'You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew about trolls,\\' said Strider \\n\\'It is broad daylight with a bright sun, and yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for us in this glade! In any case you might have noticed that one of them has an old bird\\'s nest behind his ear \\nThat would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll!\\'\\n     They all laughed \\nFrodo felt his spirits reviving: the reminder of Bilbo\\'s first successful adventure was heartening \\nThe sun, too, was warm and comforting, and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little \\nThey rested for some time in the glade, and took their mid-day meal right under the shadow of the trolls\\' large legs.\\n     \\'Won\\'t somebody give us a bit of a song, while the sun is high?\\' said Merry, when they had finished \\n\\'We haven\\'t had a song or a tale for days.\\'\\n     \\'Not since Weathertop,\\' said Frodo \\nThe others looked at him \\n\\'Don\\'t worry about me!\\' he added \\n\\'I feel much better, but I don\\'t think I could sing \\nPerhaps Sam could dig something out of his memory.\\'\\n     \\'Come on, Sam!\\' said Merry \\n\\'There\\'s more stored in your head than you let on about.\\'\\n     \\'I don\\'t know about that,\\' said Sam \\n\\'But how would this suit? It ain\\'t what I call proper poetry, if you understand me: just a bit of nonsense \\nBut these old images here brought it to my mind.\\' Standing up, with his hands behind his back, as if he was at school, he began to sing to an old tune.\\n\\n          Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,\\n           And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;\\n           For many a year he had gnawed it near,\\n           For meat was hard to come by.\\n           Done by! Gum by!\\n           In a case in the hills he dwelt alone,\\n           And meat was hard to come by.\\n\\n           Up came Tom with his big boots on.\\n           Said he to Troll: \\'Pray, what is yon?\\n           For it looks like the shin o\\' my nuncle Tim,\\n           As should be a-lyin\\' in graveyard.\\n           Caveyard!

Thinbone!\\n           He can spare a share for a poor old troll,\\n           For he don\\'t need his shinbone.\\'\\n\\n           Said Tom: \\'I don\\'t see why the likes o\\' thee\\n           Without axin\\' leave should go makin\\' free\\n           With the shank or the shin o\\' my father\\'s kin;\\n           So hand the old bone over!\\n           Rover! Trover!\\n           Though dead he be, it belongs to he;\\n           So hand the old bone over!\\'\\n\\n           \\'For a couple o\\' pins,\\' says Troll, and grins,\\n           \\'I\\'ll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins.\\n           A bit o\\' fresh meal will go down sweet!\\n           I\\'ll try my teeth on thee now.\\n           Hee now!

Mae govannen!_ His speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their hearts: the rider was of the Elven-folk \\nNo others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear \\nBut there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call, and they saw that he was now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider.\\n     Soon Strider beckoned to them, and the hobbits left the bushes and hurried down to the Road \\n\\'This is Glorfindel, who dwells in the house of Elrond,\\' said Strider.\\n     \\'Hail, and well met at last!\\' said the Elf-lord to Frodo \\n\\'I was sent from Rivendell to look for you \\nWe feared that you were in danger upon the road.\\'\\n     \\'Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?\\' cried Frodo joyfully.\\n     \\'No \\nHe had not when I departed; but that was nine days ago,\\' answered Glorfindel \\n\\'Elrond received news that troubled him \\nSome of my kindred, journeying in your land beyond the Baranduin, learned that things were amiss, and sent messages as swiftly as they could \\nThey said that the Nine were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance, for Gandalf had not returned \\nThere are few even in Rivendell that can ride openly against the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond sent out north, west, and south \\nIt was thought that you might turn far aside to avoid pursuit, and become lost in the Wilderness.\\n     \\'It was my lot to take the Road, and I came to the Bridge of Mitheithel, and left a token there, nigh on seven days ago \\nThree of the servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge, but they withdrew and I pursued them westward \\nI came also upon two others, but they turned away southward \\nSince then I have searched for your trail \\nTwo days ago I found it, and followed it over the Bridge; and today I marked where you descended from the hills again \\nBut come! There is no time for further news \\nSince you are here we must risk the peril of the Road and go \\nThere are five behind us, and when they find your trail upon the Road they will ride after us like the wind \\nAnd they are not all \\nWhere the other four may be, I do not know \\nI fear that we may find the Ford is already held against us.\\'\\n     While Glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened \\nFrodo felt a great weariness come over him \\nEver since the sun began to sink the mist before his eyes had darkened, and he felt that a shadow was coming between him and the faces of his friends \\nNow pain assailed him, and he felt cold \\nHe swayed, clutching at Sam\\'s arm.\\n     \\'My master is sick and wounded,\\' said Sam angrily \\n\\'He can\\'t go on riding after nightfall \\nHe needs rest.\\'\\n     Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety.\\n     Briefly Strider told of the attack on their camp under Weathertop, and of the deadly knife \\nHe drew out the hilt, which he had kept, and handed it to the Elf \\nGlorfindel shuddered as he took it, but he looked intently at it.\\n     \\'There are evil things written on this hilt,\\' he said; \\'though maybe your eyes cannot see them \\nKeep it, Aragorn, till we reach the house of Elrond! But be wary, and handle it as little as you may! Alas! the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal \\nI will do what I can Ã± but all the more do I urge you now to go on without rest.\\'\\n     He searched the wound on Frodo\\'s shoulder with his fingers, and his face grew graver, as if what he learned disquieted him \\nBut Frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier \\nThe dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him, as if a cloud had been withdrawn \\nHe saw his friends\\' faces more clearly again, and a measure of new hope and strength returned.\\n     \\'You shall ride my horse,\\' said Glorfindel \\n\\'I will shorten the stirrups up to the saddle-skins, and you must sit as tight as you can \\nBut you need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that I command him to bear \\nHis pace is light and smooth; and if danger presses too near, he will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot rival.\\'\\n     \\'No, he will not!\\' said Frodo \\n\\'I shall not ride him, if I am to be carried off to Rivendell or anywhere else, leaving my friends behind in danger.\\'\\n     Glorfindel smiled \\n\\'I doubt very much,\\' he said, \\'if your friends would be in danger if you were not with them! The pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace, I think \\nIt is you, Frodo, and that which you bear that brings us all in peril.\\'\\n\\n     To that Frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount Glorfindel\\'s white horse \\nThe pony was laden instead with a great part of the others\\' burdens, so that they now marched lighter, and for a time made good speed; but the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tireless feet of the Elf \\nOn he led them, into the mouth of darkness, and still on under the deep clouded night \\nThere was neither star nor moon \\nNot until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt \\nPippin, Merry, and Sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even Strider seemed by the sag of his shoulders to be weary \\nFrodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream.\\n     They cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the road-side, and fell asleep immediately \\nThey seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when Glorfindel, who had set himself to watch while they slept, awoke them again \\nThe sun had now climbed far into the morning, and the clouds and mists of the night were gone.\\n     \\'Drink this!\\' said Glorfindel to them, pouring for each in turn a little liquor from his silver-studded flask of leather \\nIt was clear as spring water and had no taste, and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as they drank it \\nEaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit (which was now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done.\\n     They had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the Road again \\nGlorfindel still urged them on, and only allowed two brief halts during the day\\'s march \\nIn this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall, and came to a point where the Road bent right and ran down towards the bottom of the valley, now making straight for the Bruinen \\nSo far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear; but often Glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment, if they lagged behind, and a look of anxiety clouded his face \\nOnce or twice he spoke to Strider in the elf-tongue.\\n     But however anxious their guides might be, it was plain that the hobbits could go no further that night \\nThey were stumbling along dizzy with weariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs \\nFrodo\\'s pain had redoubled, and during the day things about him faded to shadows of ghostly grey \\nHe almost welcomed the coming of night, for then the world seemed less pale and empty.\\n     The hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next morning \\nThere were many miles yet to go between them and the Ford, and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage.\\n     \\'Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river,\\' said Glorfindel; \\'for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us, and other danger may be waiting by the Ford.\\'\\n     The Road was still running steadily downhill, and there was now in places much grass at either side, in which the hobbits walked when they could, to ease their tired feet \\nIn the late afternoon they came to a place where the Road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone \\nEchoes ran along as they hurried forward; and there seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following their own \\nAll at once, as if through a gate of light, the Road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open \\nThere at the bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile, and beyond that the Ford of Rivendell \\nOn the further side was a steep brown bank, threaded by a winding path; and behind that the tall mountains climbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the fading sky.\\n     There was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind them; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the branches of the pines \\nOne moment Glorfindel turned and listened, then he sprang forward with a loud cry.\\n     \\'Fly!\\' he called \\n\\'Fly! The enemy is upon us!\\'\\n     The white horse leaped forward \\nThe hobbits ran down the slope \\nGlorfindel and Strider followed as rear-guard \\nThey were only half way across the flat, when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping \\nOut of the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider \\nHe reined his horse in, and halted, swaying in his saddle \\nAnother followed him, and then another; then again two more.\\n     \\'Ride forward! Ride!\\' cried Glorfindel to Frodo.\\n     He did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him \\nChecking the horse to a walk, he turned and looked back \\nThe Riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill, dark and solid, while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist \\nSuddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to wait \\nThen at once fear and hatred awoke in him \\nHis hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he drew it.\\n     \\'Ride on! Ride on!\\' cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called to the horse in the elf-tongue: _noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!_\\n     At once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the Road \\nAt the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in pursuit, and from the Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had heard filling the woods with horror in the Eastfarthing far away \\nIt was answered; and to the dismay of Frodo and his friends out from the trees and rocks away on the left four other Riders came flying \\nTwo rode towards Frodo: two galloped madly towards the Ford to cut off his escape \\nThey seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as their courses converged with his.\\n     Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder \\nHe could no longer see his friends \\nThe Riders behind were falling back: even their great steeds were no match in speed for the white elf-horse of Glorfindel \\nHe looked forward again, and hope faded \\nThere seemed no chance of reaching the Ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush \\nHe could see them clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black cloaks, and they were robed in white and grey \\nSwords were naked in their pale hands; helms were on their heads \\nTheir cold eyes glittered, and they called to him with fell voices.\\n     Fear now filled all Frodo\\'s mind \\nHe thought no longer of his sword \\nNo cry came from him \\nHe shut his eyes and clung to the horse\\'s mane \\nThe wind whistled in his ears, and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill \\nA breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a flash of white fire, the elf-horse speeding as if on wings, passed right before the face of the foremost Rider.\\n     Frodo heard the splash of water \\nIt foamed about his feet \\nHe felt the quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony path \\nHe was climbing the steep bank \\nHe was across the Ford.\\n     But the pursuers were close behind \\nAt the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about neighing fiercely \\nThere were Nine Riders at the water\\'s edge below, and Frodo\\'s spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces \\nHe knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge of Rivendell, if once the Riders crossed \\nIn any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt \\nHatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse.\\n     Suddenly the foremost Rider spurred his horse forward \\nIt checked at the water and reared up \\nWith a great effort Frodo sat upright and brandished his sword.\\n     \\'Go back!\\' he cried \\n\\'Go back to the Land of Mordor, and follow me no more! \\' His voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears \\nThe Riders halted, but Frodo had not the power of Bombadil \\nHis enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter \\n\\'Come back! Come back!\\' they called \\n\\'To Mordor we will take you!\\'\\n     \\'Go back!\\' he whispered.\\n     \\'The Ring! The Ring!\\' they cried with deadly voices; and immediately their leader urged his horse forward into the water, followed closely by two others.\\n     \\'By Elbereth and LË\\x99thien the Fair,\\' said Frodo with a last effort, lifting up his sword, \\'you shall have neither the Ring nor me!\\'\\n     Then the leader, who was now half across the Ford, stood up menacing in his stirrups, and raised up his hand \\nFrodo was stricken dumb \\nHe felt his tongue cleave to his mouth, and his heart labouring \\nHis sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand \\nThe elf-horse reared and snorted \\nThe foremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore.\\n     At that moment there came a roaring and a rushing: a noise of loud waters rolling many stones \\nDimly Frodo saw the river below him rise, and down along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves \\nWhite flames seemed to Frodo to flicker on their crests and he half fancied that he saw amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes \\nThe three Riders that were still in the midst of the Ford were overwhelmed: they disappeared, buried suddenly under angry foam \\nThose that were behind drew back in dismay.\\n     With his last failing senses Frodo heard cries, and it seemed to him that he saw, beyond the Riders that hesitated on the shore, a shining figure of white light; and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames, that flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world.\\n     The black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward in terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood \\nTheir piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away \\nThen Frodo felt himself falling, and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and engulf him together with his enemies \\nHe heard and saw no more.'"
